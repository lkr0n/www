## Challenge Statement and Files

Challenge Name: Nur geträumt
Challenge Files:
- README.TXT
- Nur geträumt.img

Abbreviated Challenge Statement, taken from README.TXT:

```
This challenge is a Macintosh disk image (Disk Copy 4.2 format, for those who need to
know) containing a 68K Macintosh program.  You must determine the passphrase used to
decode the flag contained within the application. 

Happy solving!  Be curious!
```
## Getting the disk image to load in an emulator

I used the [Mini vMac](https://www.gryphel.com/c/minivmac/)
as an emulator.  Starting up Mini vMac, gives the following:

![Textbox reading: I can not find the ROM image file vMac.ROM](/flareon10/Screenshot_20221116_062022.png)

As you can see a vMac.ROM file is necessary to emulate anything.
In order to load the "Nur geträumt.img" disk, we need to first provide vMac.ROM which can be found some place online.
Dragging the "Nur geträumt.img" into the window of Mini vMac gives the following prompt to insert a floppy:

![Floppy disk with a questionmark on grey background](/flareon10/Screenshot_20221116_062153.png)

The vMac.ROM is prompting the User to insert a floppy

Trying to drag and drop the "Nur geträumt.img" into the emulator gives: 
![Textbox reading: Open Failed](/flareon10/Screenshot_20221116_062153.png)

I had the suspicion that to load the disk, an operating system was required.
So I set out and downloaded 
[MacOS System 7.0.1](https://archive.org/details/mac_MacOS_7.0.1_compilation), a "graphical user interface-based operating system for Macintosh computers".

Draggin the system 7.0.1 rom into the emulator gives

Finally, a usable GUI! Let's load "Nur geträumt.img"

![Textbox reading: Open Failed, Failure to load "Nur geträumt.img"](/flareon10/Screenshot_20221116_062802.png)

Oh no! It still does not work. The culprit here is the filename containing 
the umlaut ä. After renaming the "Nur geträumt.img" to not contain an umlaut, the disk loads fine:

![Macintosh Desktop showing the loaded disk](/flareon10/Screenshot_20221116_062820.png)

Nur geträumt.img shows up on the desktop! 
The disk contains the executable "Nur geträumt.exe" which prompts for a password
and outputs a flag value computed from the password.

## Extracting the challenge executable from the disk image

In order to find the password, I set out to get my hands on the binary
"Nur geträumt.exe" contained inside the "Nur geträumt.img" disk image.
The disk image format is Apple DiskCopy 4.2.
Find more information on the file format 
[here](https://www.discferret.com/wiki/Apple_DiskCopy_4.2).

The format is really simple. The raw data starts at byte offset 0x54.
With this information, I used the following commands in WSL to extract the raw data of 
the disk image 

```
$ mv 'Nur geträumt.img' thing.img
$ dd skip=84 bs=1 if=thing.img of=thing.bin
1474560+0 records in
1474560+0 records out
1474560 bytes (1.5 MB, 1.4 MiB) copied, 0.966041 s, 1.5 MB/s
$ file thing.bin
thing.hfs: Macintosh HFS data (mounted) block size: 512, number of blocks: 2874, volume name: Nur getr\\212umt
```

As you can see the raw data is a HFS (Hierarchical File System).
I then used 
[HFSExplorer](https://www.catacombae.org/hfsexplorer/)
to inspect the filesystem more closely.

![Screenshot of HFSExplorer showing thing.hfs](/flareon10/Screenshot_20221116_083042.png)

The hfs in HFSExplorer with the desired executable highlighted.As you can see the filesize of the binary is zero. This stumped me at first 
but is a consequence of the hfs file format. In the hfs file format, the 
bytes making up a file are actually spread between two "forks", the data fork
and the resource fork. The file size shown in the screen shot above shows
the size of the data fork. The actual content of this file is in the resource
fork. Extracting the resource fork to the windows filesystem is easily done with 
HFSExplorer:

![Screenshot of HFSExplorer, about to extract the binary](/flareon10/Screenshot_20221116_083125.png)

Extended Attributes refers to the resource fork

## Solving the Challenge
With the binary extracted, I first looked at the strings contained in the 
binary. These are strings of interest:

```
Have fun, and enjoy the challenge! If you're still having
trouble, maybe try asking the program if it has a bit of time for you; perhaps
it will sing you a song. 
```
and
```
99 Luftballons
```

The strings reference the 1983 hitsong "99 Luftballons" by Nena as well 
as hinting that the program might sing a song for us, if asked nicely.

Specifically, the hint references the following lyrics of "99 Luftballons":

```
Hast du etwas Zeit für mich
Dann singe ich ein Lied für dich
```
which translates to

```
Do you have some time for me
Then I'll sing a song for you
```

well let's try to enter a variation of "Hast du etwas Zeit fur mich"
into the password prompt:

![The password prompt showing a string ending in flare-on.com](/flareon10/Screenshot_20221116_080119.png)

Not quite the flag yet, but getting there.As you can see the flag becomes already recognizable, it is the second line of the 
above song lyric with the usual suffix. 

To be 100% sure that I got the right flag, I downloaded a 
[german Version](http://www.knubbelmac.de/themen/system-7/)
of the operating system which allows me to enter the ü in "Hast du etwas Zeit für mich?"

![Password prompt showing flag](/flareon10/Screenshot_20221116_091905.png)

Note the umlaut in the password promptPressing try, confirms this input as the correct password:

![Password prompt showing flag](/flareon10/Screenshot_20221116_091934.png)

The password is correct! This was a really fun challenge and I learned a lot about retro computing and 
old MacIntosh. Thanks to the challenge author!
