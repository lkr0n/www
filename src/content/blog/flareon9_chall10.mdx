# Challenge Setup

Challenge Name: Encryptor
- flareon.exe
- Suspicious.txt.Encrypted

First thing I did was to open the binary `flareon.exe` in ghidra to get 
a basic idea of what the binary does. 
From this, I learned that the program will try to encrypt the files passed 
in via the commandline.
Invoking the program in cmd.exe like so:

```
flareon.exe file1.EncryptMe file2.EncryptMe
```

will produce the files:
- file1.Encrypted
- file2.Encrypted

It follows that the provided `SuspiciousFile.txt.Encrypted` has been encrypted
using `flareon.exe`. Additionally the program will write the following informative text to a file
called `HOW_TO_DECRYPT.txt` after it has completed its work:

```c
void encrypt(FILE *output,FILE *input)
{
  ulonglong mystery [17] = {0};

  byte nonce [12] = {0};
  int counter = 0;
  byte key [32] = {0};
  
  // generate random values for the key and the nonce 
  (*RtlGenRandom)(key,0x20);
  (*RtlGenRandom)(nonce,0xc);

  // encrypt the file contents and write the encrypted data to the output file
  chacha20_encryption(output,input, key, counter, nonce);

  // derive a "mystery" value from the key, counter, nonce and global variables d and n
  // i will go more into what is happening here later..
  pow_mod(mystery, key, &d, &n);

  // append values, necessary for recovery of the encrypted data
  print_hex(output,(longlong)part1);
  putc(10,output);

  print_hex(output,(longlong)&n);
  putc(10,output);

  print_hex(output,(longlong)&part3);
  putc(10,output);

  print_hex(output,(longlong)mystery);
  putc(10,output);

  return;
}
```

The function generates a 256-bit long random key and a 
96-bit long random nonce and passes that on to
the `chacha20_encryption`
function which writes the encrypted content of the input
file to the output file.
Then, the `encrypt` function also writes the values of the variables

- part1
- $n$
- part3
- $\text{mystery}  \equiv (\text{key|counter|nonce})^{d}\quad{}(\text{mod } n)$

as hexstrings seperated by newlines to the output file. (The | here denotes concatenation)

The variables
- part1
- $n$
- part3
- $d$

are globals, which are set at the start of the program.
A subset of these is also written to the How-to-File.
The values will play an 
important role in decrypting the contents of the suspicuous file later.

For now let's turn our attention to the actual encryption method implemented in `chacha20_encryption`.
The pseudo c-code of which is shown here:
```c
struct state {
    char constant[16];
    int key[8];
    int counter;
    int nonce[3];
}

int chacha20_encryption(FILE *output, FILE *input, int *key, int counter, int * nonce) {

  state hash_state;
  uint key_stream [16];
  byte block [64];
  longlong idx;
  int bytes_read;

  size_t sVar2;
  int local_104;

  // setup state for the hash function
  hash_state.constant = "expand 32-byte k";
  hash_state.key[0] = *key;
  hash_state.key[1] = key[1];
  hash_state.key[2] = key[2];
  hash_state.key[3] = key[3];
  hash_state.key[4] = key[4];
  hash_state.key[5] = key[5];
  hash_state.key[6] = key[6];
  hash_state.key[7] = key[7];
  hash_state.counter = counter;
  hash_state.nonce[0] = nonce[0];
  hash_state.nonce[1] = nonce[1];
  hash_state.nonce[2] = nonce[2];

  while( true ) {
    // read in a 64-bytes long `block` of data, exit the loop if no data left 
    // or if there was an error
    sVar2 = fread(block,1,0x40,input);
    bytes_read = (int)sVar2;
    if (bytes_read < 1) break;

    // derive the key_stream
    chacha20_block(key_stream,(uint *)&hash_state);

    // encrypt the current block by xoring the `key_stream` with the `block`
    idx = 0;
    do {
      block[idx] = block[idx] ^ *(byte *)((longlong)key_stream + idx);
      idx = idx + 1;
    } while ((int)idx < bytes_read);

    // write out the encrypted `block` to the output file
    fwrite(block,1,(longlong)bytes_read,output);

    // increment the counter in the `hash_state`
    hash_state.counter = hash_state.counter + 1;
    local_104 = bytes_read;
  }
  return local_104;
}
```

This function implements the [ChaCha20 Encryption Algorithm](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7539#section-2.4).
This algorithm is a stream cipher that uses a 256-bit long key and a 96-bit 
long nonce.
It goes through the input file in 64-byte long blocks. For each block a
key_stream is derived from the passed in key, nonce and the counter.
The key_stream is then xor-ed byte by byte against the block, yielding each iteration an 
encrypted block which is then written to the output file. The 
counter is increased by one for each 
block that has been encrypted.

Googling the constant "expand 32-byte k", I learned that 
the constant "expand 32-byte k" is commonly associated with the 
[Salsa20](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salsa20)
family of hash functions in which this string is part of the initial state
of the hash function's algorithm.
The string being contiguous on the stack implies that the hash function 
could be Chacha20.
Comparing the decompilation of the 
`chacha20_block`
function to the ChaCha20 algorithm indeed confirms that the hash function is
Chacha20.
I then read the ChaCha20
[RFC7539](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7539)
which describes
[ChaCha20 Encryption Algorithm](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7539#section-2.4)
which in turn I found to be identical to the functionality 
implemented by `chacha20_encryption`.

## How to recover the key used for the ChaCha20 Encryption?

So we now know how that the ChaCha20 encryption is used to encrypt the file contents but how is it possible to 
recover the key?

To recap: To the encrypted data, following values are appended

- part1
- $n$
- part3
- $\text{mystery}  \equiv (\text{key|counter|nonce})^{d}\quad{}(\text{mod } n)$

We'll be focusing exclusively on:

- $n$
- $d$
- mystery

as that is all what is needed for solving the challenge.

The values of $n$ and $d$
are computed once at the very start of the progam in a function I called
`init`. Again I have already labeled all of the functions and variables 
from the ghidra decompilation output.

```c
void init(void) {

  undefined8 is_prime;
  ulonglong p [17];
  ulonglong q [17];
  ulonglong pm1 [17];
  ulonglong qm1 [17];
  ulonglong phi [17];
  undefined8 local_a0 [17];
  
  // roll random numbers until one passes the primality test 
  // the primality test used is likely Miller-Rabin
  do {
    roll_for_prime(p);
    is_prime = primality_test(p);
  } while ((int)is_prime == 0);

  // roll random numbers until one passes the primality test 
  do {
    roll_for_prime(q);
    is_prime = primality_test(q);
  } while ((int)is_prime == 0);

  // compute the rsa-parameter n from the primes p and q
  multiply_bigints((ulonglong *)&n,p,q);

  // compute phi, the value of the euler totient function at n
  big_int_subtract_one((longlong *)pm1,p);
  big_int_subtract_one((longlong *)qm1,q);
  multiply_bigints(phi,pm1,qm1);

  // compute the private exponent d by finding the modular multiplicative inverse of the 
  // public exponent 0x10001 modulo phi (d is initialized to 0x10001)
  modulo_inverse((undefined4 *)&d,(undefined4 *)&d,phi);

  return;
}
```

The `init` function generates the private
[RSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem))-key $(n,d)$

It does so by randomly generating random numbers $p$ and $q$ so long until
both of them pass a primality test. I did not fully reverse the primality 
test but I have a strong suspicion that it is 
[Miller-Rabin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller%E2%80%93Rabin_primality_test)

The (probable-) primes $p$  and $q$ are then used to find 
$$
n = pq
$$

$$d
d \equiv e^{-1}\quad(\text{mod } \varphi(n))
$$

where $\varphi(n) = (p-1)(q-1)$ and $e = 0\text{x}10001$
Giving the private key $(n, d)$ and the public key $(n, e)$.

Now we know that the following line of code in `encrypt`


```c
pow_mod(mystery, key, &d, &n);
```
which is equivalent to the operation

$$
\text{mystery} \equiv (\text{key|counter|nonce})^{d}\quad(\text{mod } n)
$$
encrypts the concatenation of key, counter and nonce using the RSA private-key
$(n, d)$. Due to the properties of RSA, the original ChaCha20 key, counter and nonce can
then be recovered from `mystery` by calculating

$$
\text{key|counter|nonce} \equiv (\text{mystery})^{e}\quad(\text{mod } n)
$$

The function `encrypt` appends the values of $n$ and 
`mystery` as a hex string to the decrypted file data.
Additionally the value of the exponent $e$ is known to be 0x10001. 
Therefore we have all the necessary information to recover the ChaCha20 key, counter
and nonce that were used to encrypt the file data. This allows us to 
finally decrypt the Chacha20-encrypted data.

## Putting it all together

With all the above information in hand, it is now possible to 
decrypt the contents of `SuspiciousFile.txt.Encrypted` through the following 
steps:

- find the values of $n$ and `mystery` located after the encrypted data in `SuspiciousFile.txt.Encrypted`
- perform the computation of  $\text{mystery}^{e}(\text{mod } n)$ to recover the key|counter|nonce
- decrypt the file data using ChaCha20-Encryption with the recovered key, counter and nonce

For this I wrote the following python script:

<CodeFile filename="flareon10/decrypt.py" lang="python" / >
Executing this script gives:

```
Hello!

The flag is:

R$A_$16n1n6_15_0pp0$17e_0f_3ncryp710n@flare-on.com
