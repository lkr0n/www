I am a prolific note-taker. I have been taking notes daily for 2 years now. 
My 3 years of note-taking have amassed into thousands of lines in a big biiig text-file.
Most of these notes are just one-off comments on what I have done on a particular day and what I plan to do. Sometimes I also describe how I am feeling and reflect on life.

# Lessons learned

- most of the notes are shit, useless noise
- a good organisational system is important to make sense of your notes
- searchable notes are really great (i wish mine were more searchable).
- if u want commit to keeping a daily journal then maybe try to coalesce your productivity system into a diary. <br></br> For example, your calendar may double as diary.
- i layed down some formatting rules but over time I figured out that those were shit and uninformed.
