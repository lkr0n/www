# Challenge Setup

- Challenge Name: German Shell
- Challenge Category: Reverse Engineering

Challenge handout only consisted of a remote endpoint to connect to over netcat
and the filepath at which the flag is located on the remote server.

The flag is located at `/var/quantumLava/flag.txt`

Once connected to the remote server, you are given a shell for you to execute 
commands on. But any user input is garbled via some unknown process:

```
$ This is some text right here
/bin/sh: 1: frdf/pcabj/jmsg/pwxa/yn/vkiT: not found
```

Let's reverse it, to get the flag

# Solving the challenge

First thing I did, was to see how the garbleing treats equal prefixes.
I wanted to answer questions such as:
- Is the garbling process deterministic?
- When garbling input do garbled characters depend on previous characters?

With the following test:
```
$ This is some text right here
/bin/sh: 1: frdf/pcabj/jmsg/pwxa/yn/vkiT: not found

$ This is other text
/bin/sh: 1: knth+dprcw+yn+vkiT: not found
```
you can observe:
- The prefix has disappeared
- The two garbled outputs have a shared suffix

From this we can conclude that the garbling process first reverses the user input.

Some more experimentation:
```
$ a
/bin/sh: 1: a: not found

$ aa
/bin/sh: 1: ba: not found

$ aaa
/bin/sh: 1: cba: not found

$ aaaa
/bin/sh: 1: dcba: not found

$ aaaaa
/bin/sh: 1: edcba: not found

$ aaaaaa
/bin/sh: 1: fedcba: not found
```
reveals that ever-increasing sequences of 'a' spell out the alphabet in reverse.

This transformation holds even across non-alphabetical characters:

```
$ aaaa/aaa
/bin/sh: 1: hgf*dcba: not found
```
See how the `e` got skipped?

So to recap for alphabetical characters the transformation goes as follows:

1. reverse the input
2. rotate every character in the reversed string by its index in the non-reversed string  

# Problem: Non-alphabetical characters
Non-alphabetical characters clearly seem to be special cased. 
Recall:
```
$ This is some text right here
/bin/sh: 1: frdf/pcabj/jmsg/pwxa/yn/vkiT: not found

$ This is other text
/bin/sh: 1: knth+dprcw+yn+vkiT: not found
```

Notice that `/` is substiuted with `+` in all cases. 
Not what you would expect!

After much experimenting I just had to conclude that the non-alphabetic transformation
was random.

So I chose to ignore them!

# Solution script

My solution script applies the transformation to alphabetic characters and 
leaves non-alphabetic ones intact.

```python
symbols = "!\"#$%&'()*+,-./ "
string = "cat /var/quantumLava/flag.txt"
garbled = []
alphabet = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
for i, c in enumerate(reversed(string)):

    if c in symbols:
        garbled.append(c)
        continue

    assert c.lower() in alphabet

    idx = (ord(c.lower()) - ord('a'))
    a = alphabet[idx - i % len(alphabet)]
    garbled.append(a if c in alphabet else a.upper())

print("".join(garbled))
```

Then I just went ahead and repeatedly pasted the ouptut of the above script
into the shell prompt of the remote server until I got lucky and I got the 
flag: `nite{tr7n517t10n_u51ng_t1m3_n0t_c001_00000yx}`
