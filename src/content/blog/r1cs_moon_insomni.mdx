This is a write-up of the crypto-ctf challenge 'To The Moon' from insomnihack 2024 teaser.
I worked on this with my teammate [P3taByte](https://twitter.com/0xp374).

# Challenge Handout

We are given a r1cs-file which somehow encodes the flag.
<HexDump filename="insomni24/flag_constraints-c4328e47faf6ab5667ee70ac2f1e7225324f519aec5a525ad29de428432dcb17.r1cs"/>

# Some Preliminaries

r1cs find their use in Non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs.

## What are zero-knowledge proofs.

Please keep in mind that this written from the perspective 
from a zk-noob. That means you are legally obliged to report any inaccuracies to 
me!

Non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs find widespread use in the cryptography/cryptocurrency world.
Their basic premise is that a 'prover' is trying to proof knowledge of a factoid to an outside party, the verifier, without leaking any information about the factoid. 

How is this seemingly-paradoxical feat accomplished in practice? 

Lots of black-magic moon math, that is better explained elsewhere.

## Why zksnarks, What?

zk-snarks are zero-knowledge proofs satisfying special properties.
zk-snarks in turn find their use in the crypto(currency) world.

The r1cs format finds its use in the pipeline for building zk-snarks.

## Why Circuits, What?

Q: What exactly does the prover want to convince the verifier of?

A: The zk-people use circuits to express the statements that the prover will
   prove to the verifier.

It makes sense to use circuits because they are very powerful and you can 
express a lot of problems with them.

## Why Polynomials, What?

zk-snarks encode the computation that prover wants to prove to the 
verifier in an arithmetic circuit.
Arithmetic circuits are basically just circuits that evaluate polynomials.

## What is r1cs?

Now it is time to define the r1cs. Short for **R**ank-**1** **C**onstraint **S**ystem (r1cs).

<ImportantNote> All math operations are done module a prime p, unless stated otherwise </ImportantNote>

For an r1cs we need:
- coefficient vectors $a, b, c$ in some prime field
- vector of unknowns $x$

This is the system of constraints:
$$
\langle a, x \rangle  \langle b, x \rangle = \langle c, x \rangle 
$$
that people call r1cs.

## The challenge

The file `flag_constraints-c4328e47faf6ab5667ee70ac2f1e7225324f519aec5a525ad29de428432dcb17.r1cs` comes in the r1cs format which is understood by the
[snarkjs](https://github.com/iden3/snarkjs) tool.
Let's inspect it.

The format

The filename of the handout already hints at the flag being hidden in the constraints. 
Let's take a closer look. First we need to understand how polynomials (arithmetic)
circuits are converted to constraints. 

# How exactly do I encode a polynomial into a r1cs?
We are going to start with a polynomial (arithmetic circuit) and then convert it into arithmetic circuit.
Let's say we want to encode the following constraint:

$$
x^{2} - 16 = 0
$$

We will begin by flattening this expression. How do you do that?
Here also visualised as a tree:
![A tree with three leaf-nodes expressing the polynomial x^2 - 16](/insomni24/tree.png)

First step is to flatten the polynomial expression.
By flatten we mean: Introduce new variables such that the original polynomial 
equation can be written as formulaes of the form 

$$
a = b \text{ op } c 
$$
$$
x = y
$$

which in our example boils down to 

$$
x_2 = x_1 * x_1
$$
$$
x_3 = x_2 - 16
$$

The individual flattend operations are called gates!
We now have four different variables $x =(x_0, x_1, x_2, x_3)$ and two gates.

<ImportantNote> We explicitely set $x_0 = 1$, else we would not be able to express adding/subtracting constants in a R1Cs  </ImportantNote>

Each of these gates we will
turn into a R1CS.
That means 2 R1CS where the vectors $a$, $b$, $c$ and $x$ are 4-dimensional.
Remember in R1CS:
$$
\langle a, x \rangle  \langle b, x \rangle = \langle c, x \rangle 
$$
Let's figure out what values $a$, $b$ and $c$ take on. 


| Gate                | Value of $a$ | Value of $b$ | Value of $c$ |
| ---------------     | ------------ |------------- |------------- |
| $x_2 = x_1 * x_1 $  | $(0, 1, 0, 0)$ |  $(0, 1, 0, 0)$ | $(0, 0, 1, 0)$ |
| $x_3 = x_2 - 16$    | $(0, 0, 1, 0)$ |  $(-16, 0, 0, 0)$ | $(0, 0, 0, 1)$ | 

We did it! 
This format can now be used for further processing in the zk-snark pipeline.
Next steps would be to turn this into a QAP (Quadratic Arithmetic Program).
You can read more on that in this blogpost by Vitalik Buterin: [Quadratic Arithmetic Programs: from Zero to Hero](https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/quadratic-arithmetic-programs-from-zero-to-hero-f6d558cea649)

## Solving that challenge

Recall that in the challenge we get a r1cs 
```
{
 "n8": 32,
 "prime": "21888242871839275222246405745257275088548364400416034343698204186575808495617",
 "nVars": 2,
 "nOutputs": 0,
 "nPubInputs": 1,
 "nPrvInputs": 0,
 "nLabels": 2,
 "nConstraints": 1,
 "useCustomGates": false,
 "constraints": [
  [
   {
    "1": "21888242871839275222246405745257275088548364400416034343698204186575808495616"
   },
   {
    "1": "1"
   },
   {
    "0": "7358504996770508486687187130827958137520805565857056985433965719766776637594"
   }
  ]
 ],
 "map": [
  0,
  1
 ],
 "customGates": [
 ],
 "customGatesUses": [
 ]
```

Let's look at the constraints more closely:
```
 "constraints": [
  [
   {
    "1": "21888242871839275222246405745257275088548364400416034343698204186575808495616"
   },
   {
    "1": "1"
   },
   {
    "0": "7358504996770508486687187130827958137520805565857056985433965719766776637594"
   }
  ]
],
```

This encodes the constraint: 

$$
- x_{1}^{2} + 7358504996770508486687187130827958137520805565857056985433965719766776637594 x_0 = 0
$$


We mostly figured this out by guessing/experimenting with constraints of 
small example circuits I wrote in [circom](https://docs.circom.io/circom-language/)

Again $x_0 = 1$ because elsewise you can not add/subtract constants.
With $x_0 = 1$ this is a constraint, we can easily solve in sage:
```
F = GF(21888242871839275222246405745257275088548364400416034343698204186575808495617);

R.<x> = PolynomialRing(F);
(- x * x - 7358504996770508486687187130827958137520805565857056985433965719766776637594).roots();
```

convert both root's bytes to ascii and observe flag in one of them.
Flag is `b'INS{Nothing_to_hide_in_R1CS!!!}'`
