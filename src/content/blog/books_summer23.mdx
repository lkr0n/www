This year I really have been getting back into reading books both online and in the physical realm. 
Here is a list of works, I have recently read. For each I will give a short spoiler-free review.

## Table of Contents
{/* to be filled in by the remark-toc plugin */}

## Book 1: To The Stars, Hieronym
The first book on the list is [To The Stars](https://archiveofourown.org/works/777002/chapters/1461984) by [Hieronym](https://ttshieronym.tumblr.com/) which I actually started reading at the end of last year.
And I will be reading it for a while to come given that this piece of web-fiction has been periodically updated for over 10 years now.
The book itself is a far-future science-fiction mashup of the [Madoka Magica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puella_Magi_Madoka_Magica) universe.

I really like the world built at the hands of the author. 
It is the kind of fiction to make me hopeful and optimistic for the future.
Matter of fact: The grip this series had on me is the root cause of this recent reading spree.

## Book 2: The Stormlight Archive, Brandon Sanderson
[The Stormlight Archive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Stormlight_Archive) by [Brandon Sanderson](https://www.brandonsanderson.com/) is another long book series investing in a lot world-building. Instead of a scifi setting, this is of the fantasy genre. And at that some of the best I have ever read, granted I have not read much else beyond 
[The Lord of the Rings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings).

This book series was recommend to me by a friend who is into fantasy big-time.
I am really glad I followed up on his advice. I love the world building and overall Sanderson's writing style is really great except for that one line about 'ass-sass'. TURBO-CRINGE!

Here is my progress in the series as of july 2023:

| Book Number | Book Title          | Have Read |
|-------------|---------------------|-----------|
| 1           | The Way of Kings    | ✅ Read    | 
| 2           | Words of Radiance   | ✅ Read    | 
| 2.5         | Edgedancer (novella)| ❌ Not Read| 
| 3           | Oathbringer         | ✅ Read    |
| 3.5         | Dawnshard (novella) | ❌ Not Read|
| 4           | Rhythm of War       | ❌ Not Read|


Although I have purchased book 4, I have not yet started reading it, as I am currently taking a break from the series.
I might also read the novellas but this will largely depend on my schedule. 

## Book 3: The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, Robert A. Heinlein

[The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Moon_Is_a_Harsh_Mistress) by [Robert A. Heinlein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_A._Heinlein) is a science-fiction classic. I have bought this on the recommendation of a random person from twitter.  

I am currently still reading this and have not yet much to say. Sofar it has been quite enjoyable. I might report back once I have read further. 

## Reading List

Here are some of the books I plan to (re)-read:
- [The Three-Body Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three-Body_Problem_(novel)), [Liu Cixin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liu_Cixin)
- [Foundation series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_series), [Isaac Asimov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_series)
