This easter weekend I was playing [utctf](https://utctf.live) with [Zer0Tolerance]().
We ended up coming 4th place. During the competition I solved the 'Forgery' cryto-challenge, the writeup of which you are reading right now.

## Challenge Handout

| Handout | Comment         |
|---------|-----------------|
| forgery | 64-bit ELF stripped challenge binary |
| forgery_nostrip | 64-bit ELF challenge binary |
| betta.utctf.live 8634 | server running the challenge binary |


At first only a stripped ELF binary was provided but over the course of the 
ctf the non-stripped binary was released as well. 
As I exclusively worked on the symbolized binary, this write-up will
revolve around the binary containg symbols.

# First look at the binary

Executing the challenge binary prints a cryptic hex string representing
96 bytes. The user may then enter their own input.

All the relevant code is contained in the main function. A cursory glance 
reveals a lot of symbols referencing [bls12-381](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BLS_digital_signature#BLS12-381), which is the name to 
an elliptic curve. Oh boy!

# Explaining the math
The math going into bls12-381 is too extensive to be explained here in this blog
and I do not understand it anyway, so I will only review some of the basic
properties of the bls12-381 and the bls-signature scheme necessary for solving
the challenge.

## BLS-Signature scheme

The fundamental building blocks of this signature scheme are pairings.  
I wont go into how they work but here is how they are used in the bls signature scheme
used in the binary.

### Keys

- Public keys are points on an elliptic curve. 


### What is a pairing?

A Pairing is just some bilinear function e:

$$
e : G_1 \times G_2 \rightarrow G_T
$$

mapping the points of the elliptic curve $G_1$ and points of the elliptic 
curve $G_2$ into the group $G_T$.

In case of the BLS-signature scheme the pairing used  
and the 

That is already all we need to know! For solving the challenge it does not really
matter  

### How does the signature algorithm work?


# Reversing the binary

Googling for c++ bls12_381 libraries, I found 
[AntelopeIO/bls12-381](https://github.com/AntelopeIO/bls12-381) on github.
The function signatures and naming lign up neatly with the decompilation. 
Having found this library was a great help in speeding things up and I even ended
up using it for solving the challenge.

Reversing the binary I figured out that it

1. generates a public/private key pair from a random seed 
2. reads in a 192 hex digits representing 96 bytes of public key
3. reads in 384 hex digits representing 192 bytes of a signature 


## Signature Computation

# Solving the challenge

I then wrote a small c++ program that takes bobs public key as an input and 
spits out the evil publickey along with the forged signature.

Just submit the program output to the challenge server and get the flag.

For running this you will only need a c++ compiler and the [AntelopeIO/bls12-381](https://github.com/AntelopeIO/bls12-381) c++ library in the same folder as 
the above source files.
